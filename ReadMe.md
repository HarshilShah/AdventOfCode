# Advent of Code

My solutions for Advent of Code puzzles, written in Swift.

Every solutions is implemented as a single Swift file, organised within a Playground for each year for ease of use.

The run button within Xcode only runs a file in debug mode, so performance wonʼt be great. To run a dayʼs solution in optimised mode, use:

```
swift -O <path-to-file>
```
